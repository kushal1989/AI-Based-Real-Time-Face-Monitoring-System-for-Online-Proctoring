## 1. Business Understanding

### 1.1 Business Problem

Online exams, interviews, and certification tests have become widespread across:

- Universities and colleges  
- Recruitment platforms  
- Online certification providers  
- Corporate assessments  

However, remote assessments face serious integrity challenges, such as:

- Candidates leaving their seats during exams  
- Proxy candidates replacing the original person  
- Multiple people appearing on camera  
- Lack of continuous human monitoring  

These issues lead to:

- Compromised exam credibility  
- Unfair evaluation  
- Loss of trust in online assessment systems  

From an organizational and business perspective, impersonation results in:

- Invalid assessment outcomes  
- Increased manual proctoring costs  
- Legal and compliance risks  
- Brand reputation damage  
- Reduced acceptance of online examinations  

Manual monitoring using human proctors is:

- Expensive  
- Error-prone  
- Not scalable for large-scale exams
